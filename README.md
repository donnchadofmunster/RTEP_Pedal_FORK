# 🎛️ Real-Time Digital Effects Pedal

> A modular, real-time audio effects system for Raspberry Pi, developed in modern C++ with multithreading, low-latency processing, and unit-tested DSP effect chains.

## 📜 Project Overview

The Real-Time Harmoniser is a standalone real-time embedded system designed to apply audio effects (like pitch-shifting and gain distortion) to incoming audio with minimal latency. The pedal is controllable via a hardware interface and written for the ENG5220: Real-Time Embedded Programming course.

**Key Features:**
- Modular DSP architecture with hot-swappable effect chains
- Sample-by-sample processing for minimal latency
- Real-time capable Harmonizer using [SignalsmithStretch](https://github.com/Signalsmith-Audio/signalsmith-stretch)
- Multithreaded control-safe design with atomic buffer swapping
- CI-integrated Google Test unit testing
- Memory-safe code verified with Valgrind

## 🧩 System Architecture

```
+-----------+     +--------------+     +--------------------+
| Audio In  | --> | Sampling     | --> | DigitalSignalChain | --> Audio Out
+-----------+     +--------------+     +--------------------+
                                       |  Gain, Fuzz, Harmonizer ...
                                       +--------------------+
```

Each audio sample flows through a configurable DSP chain loaded dynamically from a config file.

## ⚙️ Getting Started

### 🔧 Prerequisites

- Raspberry Pi 4/5 (or any Linux system)
- `libsndfile1-dev`, `libasound2-dev`, `libgtest-dev`, `valgrind`
- CMake ≥ 3.7, Clang or GCC

### 🛠️ Build

```bash
chmod +x code/init.sh code/build.sh
./code/init.sh    # Installs dependencies and fetches submodules
./code/build.sh   # Builds the pedal and test binaries
```

### ▶️ Run

```bash
./code/run.sh     # Runs the real-time pedal binary
```

### ✅ Unit Tests

```bash
./code/unit_test.sh    # Runs unit tests with Valgrind
```

### 🧼 Clean

```bash
./code/clean_run.sh     # Re-builds the project and runs
./code/clean_test.sh    # Re-builds the project and runs the integration test
```

## 📊 Performance

| Metric             | Value           |
|--------------------|-----------------|
| Latency (per sample) | < 3μs (tested on x86) |
| Realtime Factor    | ~10x            |
| CPU Usage          | < 40% on RPi 4  |
| Memory Leaks       | ❌ None (Valgrind verified) |

## 🔬 Features Under Development

- Live web-based configuration via Angular UI (`shred.local`)
- Additional effects: Reverb, Delay
- Plugin support for 3rd-party effect modules
